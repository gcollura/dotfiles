My Vim Configuration
====================
My configuration has been heavily inspired by [ddellaquila/dd-vim](https://github.com/ddellaquila/dd-vim/).

Plugins
-------
I have enabled through [NeoBundle], which is a very powerful vim plugin manager. It does all the dirty
work to download, update and add/remove plugins when needed.
`bundles.vim` contains the complete lists and some configuration.
 * [YouCompleteMe]
 * [indentLine]
 * [vim-luna]
 * [Unite.vim]
 * [UltiSnips]
 * [Gundo]
 * [vim-commentary]
 * And many more...

Installation
------------
If you like how I configured vim and you want something similar on you pc, just download `<repo-name>`
somewhere and then run `./install.sh` (backup all previous configurations before).
ATTENTION: This configuration is intended to be a personal backup repo, just in case of fire.
