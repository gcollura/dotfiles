My Vim Configuration
====================
My configuration has been heavily inspired by [ddellaquila/dd-vim](https://github.com/ddellaquila/dd-vim/).

Plugins
-------
I have enabled through [NeoBundle], which is a very powerful vim plugin manager. It does all the dirty
work to download, update and add/remove plugins when needed.
`bundles.vim` contains the complete lists and some configuration.
 * [YouCompleteMe]
 * [cpp-vim]
 * [indentLine]
 * [molokai]
 * [NERDTree]
 * [UltiSnips]
 * [vim-commentary]

Installation
------------
If you like how I configured vim and you want something similar on you pc, just download `<repo-name>`
in your `$HOME/.vim` or where you know vim will look into for its startup configuration.
One day I'll write and installation script to do all the work, I promise.

Credits
